# Hourly Logging Stopwatch

The **Hourly Logging Stopwatch** is a productivity-enhancing tool designed to help users track their time and accomplishments throughout the day. It is built with a simple GUI using Python's `tkinter` library and offers an intuitive way to monitor progress while encouraging users to stay focused.

## Features

- **Start, Pause, and Reset Functions**: The stopwatch can be easily started, paused, and reset with the click of a button.
- **Hourly Log Prompts**: Every hour, a pop-up dialog prompts users to log their accomplishments, helping to reflect on what has been achieved during the time period.
- **Accomplishment Logging**: Logged accomplishments are saved in a text file for future reference, making it easy to track daily productivity.
- **Simple GUI**: The interface is user-friendly, designed with simplicity in mind to reduce distractions.

## How It Works

1. **Start the Stopwatch**: The user can begin timing by pressing the "Start" button.
2. **Pause or Reset**: The stopwatch can be paused or reset at any time.
3. **Hourly Prompts**: After every hour of active timing, the app will trigger a pop-up dialog box asking the user to input what they've accomplished during the past hour.
4. **Logging**: All accomplishments are saved in a text file (`accomplishments.txt`), allowing users to review their productivity at any time.

- **Python 3.x**
